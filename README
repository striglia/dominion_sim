My little side-project, aimed at writing a full simulator for at least part of
the card game Dominion.

Initial proof of concept would be getting the game up and running with just VP
and money cards, testing that games could be run successfully, testing that
repeated simulations could result in different outcomes.

After that, I'll start expanding card support with the goal of at least
allowing the easier of the initial cards to be used (i.e. nothing requiring
discarding knowledge, played card knowledge, or similarly hard features).

If I get a little side experience with Python or TDD, then so be it. Above 
all...it's just for fun. Sorry for the nasty code =)
